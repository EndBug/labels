# labels
This repo contains the default labels I use in my repositories.

You can use the [`labels.yml`](./labels.yml) file along with my [`EndBug/label-sync`](https://github.com/EndBug/label-sync) action to copy them to your repo: you can tweak the aliases so that you don't loose your current tags, but they only get edited.

**THIS REPO IS NOT MAINTAINED FOR PUBLIC USE**. If you want to do the same thing you're welcome to fork it or create your own, but referencing it directly could be destructive, as I may introduce breaking changes without versioning.

If you want to generate your own label config file, you can use my [`EndBug/export-label-config`](https://github.com/EndBug/export-label-config) action.
